				<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Bruzzi (2009)</h3>
				<h2>(Garrincha)</h2>
				<p>Originally from Rio de Janeiro, he began practicing capoeira at the age of 14 with Mestre Arara. When the latter had his training room removed, he then followed the lessons of Mestre Camisa, Mestre Arara's trainer, for a while. It was then that for reasons of convenience - the courses took place very close to his home - he came into contact with Mestre Garrincha, with whose school he immediately identified, a link which continues to this day. After a few years, he won his place among the advanced students, which allowed him to give lessons for beginners within a form of "capoeira university". At the same time, he trained at the University of Rio to become a physical education teacher and, from 1988, gave capoeira lessons to children and adolescents in schools. In 1993 he decided to leave for Europe: the job market for capoeristas was booming in Brazil, but people also heard that the movement was growing beyond borders: in reality, it was there. literally exploded and revealed, once again, through the baggage of the capoeirista which always conveys his experience, his wisdom and his malice, his capacity and his strength of culture of resistance. It was an opportunity to see old acquaintances again but also to meet capoeristas from all regions of Brazil.</p>
				<p>After two years of traveling through ten countries and multiple rodas, MESTRE BRUZZI returned to Brazil and resumed his work with children. Brazil was then experiencing economic expansion and capoeira attracted a large audience. But from 1998, the economic policy of the Real Plan once again became unstable and failing. In three years, the situation of the capoerists had gone from very positive energy to the return of difficulties: "the joy of the poor does not last". He then decides to return to Europe, to the south of France, where he finds an old friend, the famous Mestre Sorriso. MESTRE BRUZZI was then entrusted with working with him within the  Senzala Montpellier association  in order to develop and extend the work undertaken for five years.</p>
				<p>The work of capoeira had evolved even more than when he first visited Europe, five years earlier: there was an obvious lack of personnel for such a demand. Capoeira presented itself as a fashion phenomenon, but for those who knew it well, it did not assert itself based on this phenomenon: fashion had been created based on the success and strength that capoeira represented. Since September 2006, MESTRE BRUZZI has continued and developed its work within the association “ Escola de Capoeira Mediterranee ”. Present in most European events, it provides daily lessons for adults and children, trains advanced students who in turn create associations, implements educational actions and projects, "sponsors" a capoeira association in the east from France whose students train independently most of the time, intervene in schools, participate in most European events and organize parties, courses, festivals, baptisms, trips with and for its students. "The appearance of European instructors and professors sows the seeds of a new growth for capoeira. If the Brazilian who has exported his art and his culture throughout the world does not evolve his vision of capoeira according to the historical, social and cultural context of the environment where he lives, he runs the risk of losing his place where he himself established capoeira. Indeed, Brazilians must not forget that one of the main reasons that made us leave our homeland was the lack of recognition and support for our art within our own country.</p>
